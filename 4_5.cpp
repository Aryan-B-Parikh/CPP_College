/*
In an educational setting, an advanced grading system was conceptualized 
to accommodate the diverse evaluation criteria for students at different 
academic levels. At the heart of the system is an abstract base class that 
defines the grading framework. This class includes a protected member to 
store marks and declares a pure virtual function for computing grades, 
ensuring that specific grading logic is implemented by derived classes.
Two distinct derived classes were introduced to handle the unique grading 
needs of undergraduate and postgraduate students. Each class defines its 
own implementation of the grade computation method, reflecting the varying 
academic expectations for these groups. The system enables users to input 
student data, compute grades based on the respective criteria, and manage 
a collection of student records.
